# Configuration file for /usr/sbin/buildkernel
# Make sure the below are set correctly for your system!

# following is the partuuid of your EFI system partition
# (e.g., the first partition on your USB boot key)
# replace with an appropriate value (find with lsblk and blkid) for your system
#EFIPARTUUID="2498f874-ad8f-484e-8aba-81ac1c9665b6"

# following is the partuuid of your LUKS partition (if on a GPT drive)
# (usually, this will be a partition of a fixed drive in your machine)
# replace with an appropriate value (find with lsblk and blkid) for your system
#CRYPTPARTUUID="8111286a-d24e-4ba2-b6af-d0650fab4130"

# if your LUKS filesystem is NOT on a GPT partition (for example, if it is
# on an MBR partition, or if you have luksFormat-ed a top-level drive, rather
# than a partition within it), then you must uncomment and set the following
# variable (use "ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid" to locate the correct path)
# NB - most users will NOT need to do this (it is a special case), and
# should accordingly leave the variable commented out;
# note also that if you set CRYPTPATHMAP directly in this manner, the
# contents of CRYPTPARTUUID will be ignored
#CRYPTPATHMAP="/dev/disk/by-uuid/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"

# if using a root-filesystem other than ext4, set it here.
# buildkernel will attempt to set the correct filesystem type automatically if
# this variable is not set manually. Default is ext4.
# ROOTFILESYSTEMTYPE="ext4"

# if your LUKS keyfile is not on your EFI system partition (for example,
# because you use a USB key to hold the keyfile, but have created an EFI
# system partition on the machine's main drive), then uncomment the below
# and replace the UUID with the appropriate value (find with lsblk and blkid)
# for your system; if you do not, then KEYFILEPARTUUID=EFIPARTUUID is assumed
#KEYFILEPARTUUID="8eca6e85-3f96-4117-b1f0-864576258c4f"

# if you wish to rely only on the fallback passphrase (assuming you have set
# one up) and no keyfile, uncomment the line below; otherwise
# the value "luks-key.gpg" will be assumed (if you do set LUKSKEYFILE to the
# empty string, KEYFILEPARTUUID is ignored)
#LUKSKEYFILE=""

# by default, buildkernel will build the kernel in /usr/src/linux. If
# LINUXBUILDDIR is specified, buildkernel will delete the contents of
# LINUXBUILDDIR/buildkernel, copy the contents of /usr/src/linux there,
# then build the kernel in that directory. This can be useful for sparing write
# cycles if /usr/src/linux is located on a SSD and the specified directory lies
# e.g. on tmpfs.
#LINUXBUILDDIR="/var/tmp"

# add any additional kernel command line parameters here (most critical ones
# will be set automatically by buildkernel; you can leave this commented out)
#ADDITIONALKERNELCMDS="root_trim=yes"

# by default, genkernel will be instructed to include all firmware and modules
# into the initramfs; uncomment and change the below (for example, to specify
# an empty string) if you do not want this, or if you want to manage these
# options explicitly through /etc/genkernel.conf
# (caution - may cause boot issues on some systems)
#ADDITIONALGENKERNELOPTS="--all-ramdisk-modules --firmware"

# by default, buildkernel will ensure that an EFI boot entry for any kernel
# it creates exists at the top of the EFI boot order (in EFI NVRAM);
# uncomment and change the below (to specify value 0) if you do not want to
# do this (for example, because you wish to use your own EFI bootloader)
#CREATEEFIBOOT=1

# set your keymap - this is IMPORTANT to ensure your password for the GPG
# protected keyfile gets read correctly
# if you leave this commented out, the "us" keymap will be used
#KEYMAP="jp"

# if you want a graphical boot theme, set it here; will automatically turn
# on the 'quiet splash' kernel options
# leave commented out for a textual boot screen
#PLYMOUTHTHEME="fade-in"

# if you want to use OpenRC init, rather than the default systemd, uncommment
# the below (capitalization is unimportant)
#INITSYSTEM="openrc"

# if you want to revert to the old (<=1.0.29) behaviour of _not_ compressing
# the built-in initramfs, uncomment the line below; XZ compression is now
# used by default; some systems will not boot large kernels that contain an
# uncompressed ramfs, even though the enclosing kernel is itself compressed
#COMPRESSINITRAMFS=0

# if you need to conform the config file for some reason, uncomment this
# hook function and fill it out to suit your requirements
# NB you should only really need to do this to override a setting forced
# by buildkernel itself; other changes you make during the make menuconfig step
# are persisted, and this is the preferred way to modify the config
# user_conform_config_file() {
#     # call set_kernel_config / unset_kernel_config functions here as needed
# }

# if you need to modify the initramfs during the buildkernel process, 
# uncomment this hook function and fill it out to suit your requirements
# user_modify_initramfs() {
#     # do stuff with ${INITRAMFSDIR} directory contents;
#     # the cpio archive is already unpacked here upon function entry
#     # and will be repacked again automatically for you afterwards
# }

# leave the below two lines commented out, unless running on a *very*
# badly-behaved UEFI BIOS, that looks only at the Microsoft boot loader path
#EFIBOOTFILE="bootmgfw.efi"
#EFIBOOTDIR="/EFI/Microsoft/Boot"
